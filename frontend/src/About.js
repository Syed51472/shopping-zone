      <h2>ABOUT US </h2>
      <p>
        Agriculture plays an important role in the economy and development of
        the country. Nowadays, agricultural canters are hindered by problems
        regarding pest infections and farmers are unable to identify these pests
        as they cannot afford to test these pest infected crops due to which a
        large portion of their crops gets ruined.The idea of building PIC web-application
        is unique because there is no website like this that exists as it
        provides the user with not only the problem in terms of identifying the
        pest that is affecting the crop but also provides a solution for the
        user to deal the pest with the recommended pesticide. Since majority of
        the population of Pakistan comes from rural backgrounds, the communities
        thriving in those areas are dependent on agricultural outputs so this
        web application can benefit those people as well.
